AI-Based Diabetes Prediction Web App

Developer :
Name: S. Lavan Chary
Project Type: MINOR PROJECT

Overview :
The AI-Based Diabetes Prediction App is a web-based tool that allows users to enter their health details (like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, etc.) and receive an instant diabetes prediction.
It uses a simple logic now but can be easily integrated with an ML model later for accurate, real-time predictions.

Features :

Beautiful animated UI with HD background and smooth transitions
Auto browser launch when you run the app
Smart range suggestions for each input field
Developer credit and modern look with clean layout
Ready for machine learning model integration
Fast and lightweight — runs locally on any system


Requirements :

Python 3.8 or higher

The libraries listed in requirements.txt

To install all dependencies, run :

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run :

Open a terminal in your project folder.

Run the command :

python app.py


The app will automatically open in your default browser at:
http://127.0.0.1:5000

How It Works :

The user enters basic health information:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

BMI

Age

The app performs a dummy prediction using threshold logic :

If glucose > 125 or BMI > 30 - “Diabetic”

Else - “Non-Diabetic”

The result is displayed instantly with a smooth UI animation.

Future Enhancements :

Integrate an ML model using scikit-learn

Add database support (MySQL or SQLite) for saving patient history

Include data visualization dashboards (using Seaborn/Plotly)

Deploy on cloud (Render, Vercel, or AWS)
